Wiipy includes (or will include):

  * patches and build scripts for python 2.5.2

  * bindings to various wii libraries (ogc/ wiisprites, etc)

  * A set of python scripts to ease development on wiipy platform (including development GUI, application launcher, etc.)


Because cross-compiling environment is quite complex to setup, it is a real opportunity for non programmer hobbyists, to have fun developing their own games on the wii.
